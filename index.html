    <h1>Contributions for the Homeless</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>As of January 2018, more than 550,000 people were counted as homeless in the United States.</h2>
    <h2>No one should be left alone.</h2>
    <h2>Homelessness can happen to anybody.</h2>

      <p>We see it every day. In our commutes, a homeless pandhandles at a intersection. "Anything helps", as is the message. 
        However the question remains: <i>Will giving money to this man or woman feed an addiction? Am I helping or making it worse?</i>
      </p>

    <div class='detail'>
      <p>This is a common sight in not only the local community, but the entire nation as a whole. Common enough that people have learned to adapt to their presence. Some may donate as they wait for the light to turn green, or avert attention.</p>

      <p>Volunteering efforts have greatly raised awareness of the homeless problem. It has even improved the lives of existing homeless. Such as the efforts of Habitat for Humanity, where they have served hundreds of thousands of not just homeless but the disadvantaged since its tenure. </p>
      <p>Organizations such as Metropolitan Ministries also pursue in helping the homeless, and has extended their assistance to prevention, life rehabilitation, and much more.</p>
      <p>Anyone can attend to these organizations' services - they will serve those in need, for the community. </p>

      <p>Some may raise awareness in artistic fashion. Renato Rampolla is one such individual. Over the past year and a half he has been photographing the homeless across the country, and has published his efforts in a book <i>Dignity No Matter What, The Light Within</i>. In photographing, he also learned 40 fascinating stories. </p>
      <p>Laziness wasn't always the issue. Addiction, mental health and heartbreak were common subjects. In learning about each person, there is a basic love that isn't nearly shared as should. </p>
      <p>It is a unique way to raise awareness of the issue. But not to paint it in an overly emphasizing manner. But to express the issue as one that is just more than people stuck on the streets, loitering about. "To raise social consciousness about the homeless", as Rampolla expresses. </p>
